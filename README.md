# 🗺️ MAPSTER: Indoor Navigation App

> **MAPSTER** is an innovative **Indoor Navigation System** designed to help users find their way inside large buildings such as malls, hospitals, offices, and universities — all **without requiring internet access**.
The app utilizes **QR code-based localization** and the **A* (A-Star) algorithm** to determine the shortest path between the user’s current position and the selected destination. With a clean user interface and offline capabilities, MAPSTER provides a seamless and reliable experience for indoor navigation. It aims to assist visitors, staff, and students in navigating complex layouts with ease.
This project was built using Android Studio and written in Kotlin, with a strong focus on usability and accessibility. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts were employed in the backend to implement efficient pathfinding.
